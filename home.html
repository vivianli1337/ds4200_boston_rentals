    <h2> Overall Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            Boston ranks #4 in one of the most expensive cities to rent in the United States. Since February 2025,
            the average rental cost is about $3.4k per month, 119% higher than the average national rental cost of
            $1.5k per month (<em> <a
                    href="https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/boston-ma/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">
                    Apartment.com</a></em>).
            A 1-bedroom unit costs about $3.4k per month while a 3-bedroom unit costs about $5.8k a month.
            The rental costs and housing conditions vary, depending on the location of the house and its surrounding
            areas.
            Housing affordability and amenities are some of the main factors that shape the students’ college
            experience,
            financial stability, and overall well-being.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Northeastern, a majority of the students move off campus after their 1st or 2nd year. With rising rental
            costs and living expenses, off-campus students face significant challenges in selecting the right apartment
            in terms of affordability, distance to campus, and available amenities. Amenities such as in-unit laundry,
            furnished spaces, and access to public transportation influence housing choices, yet the interplay between
            cost and convenience remains understudied. Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing how
            affordability and key features shape student housing decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our research project is supported by existing research on Boston’s vast real estate market. The first paper,
            <strong><em><a href="https://iacis.org/iis/2018/2_iis_2018_109-118.pdf" target="_blank">
                        Analysis and Prediction of Real Estate Prices: A Case of the Boston Housing
                        Market</a></em></strong>,
            published in the International Association of Computer Information Systems, examines how properties’
            attributes,
            crime rates, and accessibility influence real estate prices using machine learning models, property
            assessment
            records, and geospatial data. The findings can help contextualize affordability trends for students who live
            in Boston (see <strong>Table 1</strong>).
        </p>

        <p>
            The second paper, <strong><em><a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/pdf/BostonMA-CHMA-24.pdf"
                        target="_blank">
                        Comprehensive Housing Market Analysis for Boston, Massachusetts</a></em></strong>, published by
            the U.S. Department
            of Housing and Urban Development, provides a 2024 market overview, highlighting that Boston’s rental vacancy
            is 6.2% and the average monthly rent in the city is $2,879. It also provides data and comprehensive charts
            on rental vacancy rates, rental unit distribution, and rising rent prices in the area, providing insight
            into student housing choices through the lens of affordability (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).

        <p>
            Introduces the key trends in Boston’s rental market, demonstrating an increasing vacancy rate in 2024 and
            rising average rents (three-bedroom units have an average rent of $4,182).

            Boston.
            The declining affordability index in recent years demonstrates that rising rates are outpacing income
            growth,
            which impacts students’ housing choices.
        </p>

        <p>
            By integrating the findings from these reference papers with our survey of Northeastern students living
            off-campus, we aim to explore how rental costs and amenities influence student living preferences and
            financial well-being. Through this analysis, we hope to identify key affordability trends, identify the most
            valued housing amenities, and assess those trade-offs that students must make when selecting their housing.
        </p>

            <h2>Data Collection Process</h2>
            <p>
                To explore the impact of rental costs and housing amenities on students at Northeastern University, we
                conducted a survey targeting only students living off-campus. The survey was distributed within our
                networks, including friends and peers, ensuring a diverse set of responses across different living
                situations. To encourage participation, we structured the survey to only include essential questions
                that would provide meaningful insights while avoiding unnecessary complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvwI2bZDSv7DUw5RWuYH5iXIvIS1lFwmBBQpdPcrLir-BvpQ/viewform?usp=sharing">survey</a>
                included both categorical and continuous variables, covering aspects such as rental type,
                number of occupants, monthly rent, amenities, neighborhood, and proximity to public transportation. We
                also gathered financial data, including monthly personal income and whether utilities were included in
                the rent to evaluate affordability. Our dataset consists of 103 responses, ensuring a comprehensive and
                representative sample of Northeastern students’ off-campus housing experiences. All responses were
                confidential, allowing students to be completely transparent about their housing situations and income.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dataset enables us to identify key affordability trends and student housing preferences in rental
                decisions, providing valuable insights into the Boston rental market from the perspective of a
                Northeastern student.
            </p>

            <h2>Analysis Plan + Visualization</h2>
            <p>
                Before we conduct any analysis, we will preprocess and clean the data to ensure consistency, accuracy,
                and usability. We will first handle all missing values. If participants left any responses blank, we
                will input the most frequent responses based on their geographical location for the categorical
                variables. For missing numerical values, we will use average/median imputation based on location. Since
                the responses for rent cost and utilities are given in ranges, we will use the midpoint of each range as
                the numerical value for analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                To prepare the categorical data for statistical models, we will convert all categorical data into
                numerical formats by applying dummy encoding to variables like “Neighborhood,” “Amenities,” and
                “Furnishing Type.” Additionally, we will use ordinal encoding for features like proximity to public
                transportation. Lastly, we will normalize the monthly income values by using midpoint values to ensure
                consistency in numerical

            <h2>Interactive Rental Map</h2>
            <iframe src="boston_rent_map.html" width="80%" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>

            <p>
                To visualize the student housing data across Boston, we created an interactive map that highlights
                neighborhood-level insights. Areas shaded in color represent neighborhoods where we collected survey
                responses, while black areas indicate regions with no data. When hovering over each neighborhood, users
                can view key details such as the average number of bedrooms and bathrooms, rent-to-income ratio, cost
                per person, the distribution of furnished,
                partially furnished, and unfurnished units, average rent, average utility costs, and a count of
                amenities offered
                (e.g., gym access, free laundry, parking, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of coverage, our data includes most neighborhoods in the Boston area, with the exception of the
                South End, Chinatown, Leather District, and Bay Village. This gap is likely due to those neighborhoods
                not being explicitly listed as options in the survey, possibly because they are less well-known among
                students. As a result, data from nearby neighborhoods may partially reflect responses from students
                living in or near
                those unlisted areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                From a cost perspective, neighborhoods located near Northeastern University, the Financial District, and
                shopping centers like Newbury Street tend to have higher average rent. However, it's important to note
                that rent levels may also be influenced by factors such as the number of bedrooms or the availability of
                amenities, which vary across different listings.
            </p>
            <p>
                The map also visualizes the Cost Per Person (average rent divided by the number of
                bedrooms), revealing key affordability trends. Neighborhoods such as South Boston, Downtown, and
                the Financial District have the highest per-person housing costs, likely due to their
                luxury developments, central locations, and access to shopping, nightlife, and transit. In contrast,
                areas like Jamaica Plain, Roslindale, and parts of Dorchester appear more affordable,
                possibly due to larger units and shared housing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interestingly, when we examine the Rent-to-Income Ratio (average rent divided by
                average personal income), the picture becomes more nuanced. In neighborhoods like Jamaica Plain,
                Roxbury, and Mission Hill, the ratio exceeds 1.0, meaning students are, on average,
                spending more on rent than they earn monthly, a sign of financial strain. These students may be
                relying on savings, loans, or outside support, and their situations may be less sustainable over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, more expensive neighborhoods such as Fenway, Back Bay, South Boston
                Waterfront, Downtown, and Beacon Hill show rent-to-income ratios below 1.0. This suggests
                that although rent is high, students in these areas likely have higher incomes or more financial
                resources, and may be sharing costs with multiple roommates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several black-shaded regions, including Allston, Brighton, and East Boston, reflect
                missing or invalid rent-to-income data. Notably, these are known student-heavy neighborhoods, so their
                absence highlights survey limitations rather than true student housing trends. Overall, by combining
                cost-per-person and rent-to-income data, we gain a richer understanding of both where students
                are living and whether they can afford to.

        <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
        <script src="rent_vs_income.js"></script>

        <p>
            This scatter plot explores the relationship between average personal income and average total rent across
            various Boston neighborhoods.
            Due to missing values in either rent or income, we imputed the missing data by calculating the average
            within
            each respective neighborhood.
            This helped ensure the dataset remained representative and complete. Because of the similarities in
            responses
            within neighborhoods, many points overlap on the chart.
        </p>

        <p>
            The red regression line captures the overall trend between personal income and rent. By default, it shows a
            slight upward slope, indicating that as student income increases, total rent tends to increase as well.
            This reflects a general pattern where students with higher earnings are more likely to live in higher-cost
            housing.
            Users can interact with the chart by unchecking neighborhoods to isolate specific areas and adjusting the
            opacity to better distinguish overlapping points.
        </p>

        <p>
            When filtering to include only The Fenway/Kenmore, Roxbury, Mission Hill, and Jamaica Plain, neighborhoods
            where
            many Northeastern students live, the regression line flattens and slightly tilts downward.
            This suggests that in these student-dense areas, higher income does not consistently lead to higher rent.
            In some cases, lower-income students are paying rents comparable to or higher than their higher-income
            peers.
            This may reflect limited affordable housing options, forcing students to pay market rates regardless of
            their
            income.
        </p>

        <p>
            When South Boston, the Seaport District, the West End, and the North End are added, the regression line
            begins
            to tilt further downward.
            While these areas tend to have higher average rents, they may also include students with modest incomes who
            rely
            on roommates, family support, or financial aid to cover costs.
            This slightly distorts the expected relationship between income and rent.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast, when we focus only on neighborhoods like Downtown, the Waterfront, Beacon Hill, Back Bay, North
            End, West End, South Boston, and the Seaport District, the regression line becomes positively sloped.
            Data points in this filtered view only appear when average personal income exceeds $5,000, suggesting that
            these
            high-rent neighborhoods are financially accessible only to students with substantial income or external
            financial support.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, this chart highlights the wide financial disparity among students, with average personal
            incomes
            ranging from $2,000 to $7,500.
            In more affordable student-heavy areas, rent appears largely disconnected from income, possibly due to
            uniform
            pricing or constrained supply.
            Meanwhile, in higher-income neighborhoods, rent tracks more closely with income, reflecting a more typical
            market-driven relationship. <br>

            <p>
                This analysis examines how specific amenities correlate to the average total rent, including
                utilities, as our objective is to analyze affordability and student housing and students care more
                about how much they’re paying each month in total (not just the base rent).
                Each bar in the visualization represents the mean rent price for units that include that amenity.
                This graph allows us to see which features may drive higher rental costs for the students we
                surveyed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the chart, amenities like having laundry facilities with no additional cost to the rent,
                being pet-friendly, and having access to parking were associated with higher average rent prices.
                This reflects both the cost of providing these services and the perceived value to students. For
                example, parking shows one of the highest average rents, suggesting that convenience and
                accessibility to this feature come at a premium, especially in an urban area.
                There is also an outlier in this data, as only one property includes a roof deck. Because there is
                no other listing with the same amenity, its average rent cannot be meaningfully compared to other
                amenities.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it's also important to note that amenities are not the only factor influencing rent prices.
                Other characteristics, like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in a unit, can significantly impact
                overall rent, encouraging a deeper and holistic investigation into the impacts of rent, which our
                other visualizations examine.
                This is an important consideration, as an initial scan of the graph would show that properties with
                no additional amenities average in the middle of total rent costs.
