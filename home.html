    <h1 style="color:black"> Boston Rental Analysis </h1>
    <h2> Overall Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            Boston ranks #4 in one of the most expensive cities to rent in the United States. Since February 2025,
            the average rental cost is about $3.4k per month, 119% higher than the average national rental cost of
            $1.5k per month (<em> <a href="https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/boston-ma/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> Apartment.com</a></em>). 
            A 1-bedroom unit costs about $3.4k per month while a 3-bedroom unit costs about $5.8k a month. 
            The rental costs and housing conditions vary, depending on the location of the house and its surrounding areas. 
            Housing affordability and amenities are some of the main factors that shape the students’ college experience, 
            financial stability, and overall well-being.

        <p>
            At Northeastern, a majority of the students move off campus after their 1st or 2nd year. With rising rental
            costs and living expenses, off-campus students face significant challenges in selecting the right apartment
            in terms of affordability, distance to campus, and available amenities. Amenities such as in-unit laundry,
            furnished spaces, and access to public transportation influence housing choices, yet the interplay between
            cost and convenience remains understudied. Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing how
            affordability and key features shape student housing decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our research project is supported by existing research on Boston’s vast real estate market. The first paper,
            <strong><em><a href="https://iacis.org/iis/2018/2_iis_2018_109-118.pdf" target="_blank">
                        Analysis and Prediction of Real Estate Prices: A Case of the Boston Housing
                        Market</a></em></strong>,
            published in the International Association of Computer Information Systems, examines how properties’
            attributes,
            crime rates, and accessibility influence real estate prices using machine learning models, property
            assessment
            records, and geospatial data. The findings can help contextualize affordability trends for students who live
            in Boston (see <strong>Table 1</strong>).
        </p>

        <p>
            The second paper, <strong><em><a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/pdf/BostonMA-CHMA-24.pdf"
                        target="_blank">
                        Comprehensive Housing Market Analysis for Boston, Massachusetts</a></em></strong>, published by
            the U.S. Department
            of Housing and Urban Development, provides a 2024 market overview, highlighting that Boston’s rental vacancy
            is 6.2% and the average monthly rent in the city is $2,879. It also provides data and comprehensive charts
            on rental vacancy rates, rental unit distribution, and rising rent prices in the area, providing insight
            into student housing choices through the lens of affordability (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).
        </p>

        <h2>insert: Table 1</h2>
        <p>
            Introduces the key trends in Boston’s rental market, demonstrating an increasing vacancy rate in 2024 and
            rising average rents (three-bedroom units have an average rent of $4,182).
        </p>

        <h2>insert: Figure 1</h2>
        <p>
            Introduces the relationship between rent growth, median income changes, and the affordability index in
            Boston.
            The declining affordability index in recent years demonstrates that rising rates are outpacing income
            growth,
            which impacts students’ housing choices.
        </p>

        <p>
            By integrating the findings from these reference papers with our survey of Northeastern students living
            off-campus, we aim to explore how rental costs and amenities influence student living preferences and
            financial well-being. Through this analysis, we hope to identify key affordability trends, identify the most
            valued housing amenities, and assess those trade-offs that students must make when selecting their housing.
